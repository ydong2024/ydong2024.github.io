- name: A family of operator splitting methods revisited
  gh_user: ydong2024
  desc: A family of operator splitting methods for maximal monotone operators is investigated.It generalizes the Douglas–Peaceman–Rachford–Varga class of methods in the way that it allows the scaling parameters to vary from iteration to iteration non-monotonically.Conditions for convergence of methods within this family and for obtaining a linear rate of convergence are given. These conditions cover more general cases than the existing ones.

- name: New properties of forward–backward splitting and a practical proximal-descent algorithm
  gh_user: ydong2024
  desc: In this paper, we discuss a proximal-descent algorithm for ﬁnding a zero of the sum of two maximal monotone operators in a real Hilbert space. Some new properties of forward–backward splitting are given, which extend the well-known properties of the usual projection. Then, they are used to analyze the wea k convergence of the proximal-descent algorithm without assuming Lipschitz continuity of the forward operator. We also give a new technique of choosing trial values of the step length involved in an Armijo-like condition, which returns the (not necessarily decreasing) step length self-adaptively.

- name: 库恩—塔克条件教学中两个容易忽略的问题
  gh_user: ydong2024
  desc: 库恩-塔克条件是同时含有等式与不等式约束函数的优化问题的最优性条件,已成为优化与控制、运筹与管理的一个核心内容。笔者通过多年的教学实践,发现了两个容易忽略的问题。第一个,对比经典的拉格朗日乘子法(针对于仅含等式约束医数的优化问题)，它的推导方法并不是库恩一塔克条件的推导方法一个推广。第二个,库恩-塔克条件中的拉格朗日乘子(存在的话) 未必是唯一的。

- name:  Weak convergence of an extended splitting method for monotone inclusions
  gh_user: ydong2024
  desc: In this article, we consider the problem of finding zeros of monotone inclusions of three operators in real Hilbert spaces, where the first operator’s inverse is strongly monotone and the third is linearly composed, and we suggest an extended splitting method.

- name: AN INERTIAL SPLITTING METHOD FOR MONOTONE INCLUSIONS OF THREE OPERATORS
  gh_user: ydong2024
  desc: In this article, we consider monotone inclusions of three operators in real Hilbert spaces and suggest an inertial version of a generalized Douglas-Rachford splitting. Under standard assumptions, we prove its weak and strong convergence properties. The newly-developed proof techniques are based on the characteristic operator and thus are more self-contained and less convoluted. Rudimentary experiments demonstrated that our suggested inertial splitting method can efficiently solve some large-scale test problems.

- name: Extended splitting methods for systems of three-operator monotone inclusions with continuous operators
  gh_user: ydong2024
  desc: In this article, we propose two new splitting methods for solving systems of three-operator monotone inclusions in real Hilbert spaces, where the first operator is continuous monotone, the second is maximal monotone and the third is maximal monotone and is linearly composed.
