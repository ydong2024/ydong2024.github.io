- name: A family of operator splitting methods revisited
  gh_user: ydong2024
  desc: A family of operator splitting methods for maximal monotone operators is investigated.It generalizes the Douglas–Peaceman–Rachford–Varga class of methods in the way that it allows the scaling parameters to vary from iteration to iteration non-monotonically.Conditions for convergence of methods within this family and for obtaining a linear rate of convergence are given. These conditions cover more general cases than the existing ones.

- name:  Weak convergence of an extended splitting method for monotone inclusions
  gh_user: ydong2024
  desc: In this article, we consider the problem of finding zeros of monotone inclusions of three operators in real Hilbert spaces, where the first operator’s inverse is strongly monotone and the third is linearly composed, and we suggest an extended splitting method.

- name: AN INERTIAL SPLITTING METHOD FOR MONOTONE INCLUSIONS OF THREE OPERATORS
  gh_user: ydong2024
  desc: In this article, we consider monotone inclusions of three operators in real Hilbert spaces and suggest an inertial version of a generalized Douglas-Rachford splitting. Under standard assumptions, we prove its weak and strong convergence properties. The newly-developed proof techniques are based on the characteristic operator and thus are more self-contained and less convoluted. Rudimentary experiments demonstrated that our suggested inertial splitting method can efficiently solve some large-scale test problems.

- name: Extended splitting methods for systems of three-operator monotone inclusions with continuous operators
  gh_user: ydong2024
  desc: In this article, we propose two new splitting methods for solving systems of three-operator monotone inclusions in real Hilbert spaces, where the first operator is continuous monotone, the second is maximal monotone and the third is maximal monotone and is linearly composed.
